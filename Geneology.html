     <h3> <p Style="font-family:fantasy">
    The fifth chapter of Genesis includes the first genealogy in Scripture and introduces “the written account of the descendants of Adam.” Ten generations are listed here, from Adam to Noah (Genesis 11:10-26).
      </p>  </h3>  
        
     <h3> <p Style="font-family:inherit">
     When a person reads The Bible for the first time, inevitably they come across the geneology. Adam had Seth and Seth had Enosh and Enosh had... Etc. Why??? The custom is to give a name to someone that has a meaning. 
     </p>  </h3>    

         <h3> <p Style="font-family:inherit">
 Interesting fact...Methuselah lived 969 years. The crazy thing is the meaning of his name. His name means... His Death Shall Bring. How would like to have a name like that People were told at that time that a great flood would come and it would happen after he dies. Imagine...One sneeze and everyone would go into a panic.</p>  </h3> 
        
     <h3> <p Style="font-family: cursive">
    Adam means man and Seth means appointed and Enosh means mortal. There seems to be a message. Since this was the inspired work of God to the author of The Book Of Genesis. Below is the hidden message based on the names in the order given. 
         </p></h3>
    <img src="images/GeneologyofJesus.png"
         
    <h3> <p Style="font-family:inherit">
 Let's spell this message out. Man was appointed (made mortal or doomed to die). Sorrow (sadness and the knowledge that death will come)was in the heart of man. BUT...the Blessed God (Jesus), shall come down teaching that His death (on the cross) will bring those who dispair rest (hope in the knowledge that those who believe in him will live again).
      </p>  </h3>  

        <h3> <p Style="font-family:inherit">
In the Jewish faith, they do not believe in Jesus and would never insert this message into the holy book of Genesis. BUT...They must retain the inspired word of God exactly as it was given to them. Clearly this is the signature of God. As Chuck Missler and Perry Stone always say, “The New Testament is the Old Testament concealed, and the Old Testament is the New Testament revealed.”
