     <h4> <p Style="font-family:fantasy">
The Bible is full of hidden parallels. There is no greater example than The Book of Jonah. In this book a prophet named Jonah was instructed to go to the nation of Ninevah. He hated the idea and actually went in the opposite direction. God still directed him because his journey would reflect that of Jesus. His Journey has many parallels to Jesus.</p>  </h4>  
            
     <h4> <p Style="font-family:fantasy">
Why did Jonah go the opposite direction? The Ninevites harrassed the people of Israel all the time. They would raid farms and village. They would rape and kill the people as well. Jonah was also stubborn and would rather die then deliver a message of doom. After all...If he did go that might save them.  </p>  </h4>
            
 <h4> <p Style="font-family:fantasy">
Also consider this...Imagine being swallowed by a fish and staying in his gut for 3 days. I'll bet Jonah was bleached white (the look of death), when he was spit out onto the shores of Ninevah. The people of Ninevah would have thought he came from the dead (which is exactly what happened to Jesus 800 years later) </p> </h4>

                 <h3> <p Style="font-family:fantasy">
<h3>Here are just some examples...</h3> <b>
                     <h4>1•	A supernatural storm enveloped the boot while Jonah slept below deck and Jesus was in a storm during a supernatural storm.</h4></b>

                     <h4>2•	When Jonah was tossed overboard everything became calm. When Jesus came on deck and stretched out his hands everything became calm.</h4>

                     <h4>3•	Jonah was swallowed by a giant fish. The name Jesus when pronounced a certain way in Greek sounds like fish and was used to identify fellow Christian during the Roman period after Jesus was crucified.</h4>
