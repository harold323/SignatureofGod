   <h2>Evidence of Supernatural Design?</h2>
  
    <h3><b>* The books were originally written in Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic (example: Genesis was originally in Hebrew and The Book of Matthew was originally in Greek. It just so happens that these languages were considered mathematically perfect. An Interesting coincidence, yet Jews do not believe in coincidences. As stated by Chuck Missler "The 66 books which we call the Bible constitute a highly integrated message system. What makes this so astonishing is the fact that they were penned by more than forty different people over a period of several thousand years! Yet we now discover that virtually every detail of the Biblical text evidences a highly skillful integrated design from cover to cover. In fact, every word, every place name, every detail was apparently placed there (in the original) deliberately as part of an overall intricate plan...

      <h3> The number 7 seems to be very important, it is considered to be the number of completion or perfection. Let's see what gold nuggets appear.</h3>
    <h3><i> 1- The books in their original language combined are divisible by 7</i></h3>
    <h3><i> 2- Each book is divisible by 7</i></h3>
    <h3><i> 3- The names of all the prophets who predicted the future were divisible by 7 and when combined are divisible by 7</i></h3>
    <h3><i> 4- There were female prophets whose names were divisible by 7 </i></h3>
    <h3><i> In fact the number 7 is so important that a man named Ivan Panin devoted his life to finding this pattern. Go to the link below. </i></h3>
