   <h4><p> When people read the Bible they often wonder... Are the accounts true? Did these people really live and is this a book I can rely on for truth? Good questions that deserve an answer. After all if your going to put your faith in it, then you will want to know if it is truly God inspired or just the active imagination of other people.</p></h4>

    <h3><p> At this site there are three topics covered...Numerology, Geneology, The Book Of Jonah and then there is the gallery to view other images and links to other sources. Why these topics? To know if the Bible is God inspired, you would have to ask the question...How does God prove it? </p></h3>

    <h3><p> When we sign a contract our signature is proof that we agree to what is said in that paper. For God to sign off on this work he would have to prove that his signature is real and what better way to do this then to integrate the proof into the Bible in such a way that it can only be the inspired work of God. </p></h3>
    
    <h3><p> Only a God that is omnipotent could integrate a signature of authenticity into the lives of people throughout time. The signature of God can be found in these topics among many others.  </p></h3>
